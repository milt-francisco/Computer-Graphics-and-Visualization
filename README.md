### How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by reviewing and understanding the goal. Ideally, I have the goal easily available so I can tailor my approach to them. In this case, the reference picture.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project has allowed me to break down complex objects into smaller more manageable parts. Additionally, I have found a large appreciation for computer generated graphics.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
For my project, I implemented different parts of the project each week, and gradually increased the complexity until reaching the finished product.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The idea of breaking something large into smaller parts is prevalent in almost every industry. The problem solving skills will follow me throughout any career I choose.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by becoming very familiar with the requirements.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I did not necessarily use any new strategies. Although, the strategies from previous endeavors, such as research and debugging, were heavily relied upon. 

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Every week I implemented something new for this scene, from complex objects, to textures, to materials and lighting.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goals include living a satisfied life with my family and computer science can help me achieve a job I enjoy.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
While I am unsure if we will continue learning about OpenGL, being exposed to new software like this is exciting! I think parts of each course will be applied going forward.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I do not believe I will go into a career in graphics, but I have developed a large appreciation for those that do.
